"How long have you lived?" asked Button-Bright.

The King coughed again and turned a bit bluer. "That is considered
an impertinent question in Sky Island," he answered, "but I will say
that every Boolooroo is elected to reign three hundred years, and
I've reigned not quite---ahem!---two hundred."

"Are your kings elected, then?" asked Cap'n Bill.

"Yes, of course. This is a Republic, you know. The people elect all
their officers from the King down. Every man and every woman is a
voter. The Boolooroo tells them whom to vote for, and if they don't
obey, they are severely punished. It's a fine system of government,
and the only thing I object to is electing the Boolooroo for only
three hundred years. It ought to be for life. My successor has
already been elected, but he can't reign for a hundred years to
come."

"I think three hundred years is plenty long enough," said Trot. "It
gives someone else a chance to rule, an' I wouldn't be s'prised if
the next king is a better one. Seems to me you're not much of a
Boolooroo."
